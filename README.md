# Minna no Anime: Halloween Programs
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/minna-no-halloween-programs

Backup program for Minna no Anime's Anime Trivia and Anime Eyes games during Halloween Party. The program will be cross-platform-compatible in the event that we do not have a Mac with the latest update available in club.

I have since moved the game development to using LOVE2D, and I will import that into a branch at some point in the future.
